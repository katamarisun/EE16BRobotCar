    "This week, we will revisit our control scheme from Phase 2. Recall that our control scheme for SIXT33N modeled each wheel in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_L[k+1] = d_L[k] + \\theta_L u_L[k] - \\beta_L$$\n",
    "$$d_R[k+1] = d_R[k] + \\theta_R u_R[k] - \\beta_R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The open loop model has an input $u[k]$ which corresponds to the PWM level and outputs the distance for that wheel (thus the $C$ matrix is just the identity matrix), and $\\theta$ and $\\beta$ are the constants we found in Phase 2. We implemented a closed-loop controller by using the desired velocity and the difference between the wheel distances $\\delta[k] = d_L[k] - d_R[k]$. This lead to the control equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_L[k+1]= \\frac{v^* + \\beta_L - k_L \\delta[k]}{\\theta_L}$$\n",
    "$$ u_R[k+1]= \\frac{v^* + \\beta_R + k_R \\delta[k]}{\\theta_R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we will add the the control scheme from Phase 2 and implement turns. We will use the closed loop control scheme we developed to make SIXT33N move straight to come up with a way to make the car turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this phase are as follows:\n",
    "- Verify all of SIXT33N's hardware is working\n",
    "- Implement turns\n",

    "Now, let's think of a way to implement a turn given the system that you already have. Note that a 'turn' is as simple or as complicated as you make it. Having SIXT33N literally turn 90 degrees in place suffices, or SIXT33N can travel forward while turning. Also note that your wheels can only go forward, so setting a negative velocity or position would not work. This should be a simple addition to your model$-$ think about the easiest signals you can manipulate to get the car to turn (Hint: the inputs to the system)."

    "\n",
    "Let's say the right wheel has moved further than the left ($d_R[k] > d_L[k]$), which will result in a negative $\\delta[k]$. A negative $\\delta[k]$ will result in a reduction of $u_R[k]$, and an increase of $u_L[k]$. But what does this mean physically?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the right wheel is getting ahead of the left one, the left wheel will need to move a little faster and the right wheel a little slower for the wheels to even back out. We can use this to our advantage to make SIXT33N turn. We can 'trick' SIXT33N by adjusting the state (ie: position) of our controller."

This is the initial PWM level (between 0 and 255) that the wheels start at when it starts to drive. When you run the car, if it does not start moving and make some noise instead, increase this constant. If the car immediately moves too fast and you would like to slow it down when it just starts driving, decrease this constant. You would need to also save this number for later sketches.\n",
