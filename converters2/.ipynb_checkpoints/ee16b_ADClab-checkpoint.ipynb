    "Welcome to the the second module in this series. Last week, we built a circuit that went from 4-bit digital signals to analog values, and then modified it to convert analog signals into 4-bit digital values. This week, we will be doing the same thing, just with more bits. The picture below should be familiar from last week:\n",

    "This lab focuses on how sampling and discretization are used to go from analog voltages to a binary representation. We will also learn how to use another IC (integrated circuit) chip. Some of the sampling stuff might not make complete sense today; you will learn more in lecture near the end of the semester. "
